I just tried to creat students registration to course.
This program uses akka stream for creating reactive application.
Stream process is: source->flow->sink
in source creates student objects by emiiting data elements  has one output 
in process takes student registr to course and return student object one input, request and accept data 
in sink part prints after every finished process connect upstream and down stream
in the main part actor created using Actorsystem 
Runnnable graph A Flow that has both ends “attached” to a Source and Sink respectively, and is ready to be run().
